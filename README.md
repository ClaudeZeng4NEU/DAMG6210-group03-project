## 🎯 Mission Statement
This project involves designing and creating a relational database for a moving services company. To store, manage, and retrieve vital information about customers, relocation orders, vehicle fleets, crew assignments, inventory, pricing estimates, and payments, the database will serve as the operational foundation. The database will be designed to meet both operational needs (scheduling moves and managing resources) and analytical needs (tracking revenue trends, vehicle utilization, and service efficiency).

## 📋 Objectives
1. Customer & Lead Management: Keep track of customer contact details, profiles, and communication history. Track lead status (e.g., inquiry, quoted, booked, or completed) to manage the sales pipeline.
2. Order & Estimation Management: Maintain details of moving requests, including origin and destination addresses, property types (e.g., apartment, house), and floor levels. Generate cost estimates based on distance, volume, and service type.
3. Resource Scheduling: Manage the availability and assignment of moving trucks and crew members (drivers and movers). Ensure that assets are efficiently allocated to specific time slots without double-booking.
4. Inventory & Packing Tracking: Record detailed lists of items to be moved, including furniture and boxes. Track special requirements for fragile or high-value items (e.g., pianos, artwork) and the usage of packing materials.
5. Billing & Payments: Generate precise invoices based on final labor hours, travel distance, packing supplies used, and additional services (e.g., furniture assembly). Track payment methods, deposits, and outstanding balances.
6. Fleet Management: Store and access vehicle details (License plate, model, capacity, status: available/maintenance). Link vehicles to specific orders and track mileage for maintenance scheduling.
7. Operational & Business Support: Provide reporting for total revenue, peak moving seasons, and crew performance. Support customer service by quickly retrieving job logs and claims information. Customer Feedback & Service Rating
8. Management: Capture post-service customer feedback and service ratings to evaluate service quality, identify improvement areas, and support performance-based decision making.
9. Geographic Coverage & Route Optimization Support: Maintain geographic zone data and route-related information to support distance analysis, service area planning, and optimization of travel routes for operational efficiency.
